## Installation
To use the software, it is necessary to install these libraries.
- [     "jdatetime==4.1.0",
        "mysql-connector-python==8.0.31",
        "PyQt5==5.15.7",
        "pyserial==3.5",
        "playsound==1.2.2",
        ]
"First, you must install the MySQl database on your system. Next, you should configure the database in the 
views.mywies section. After that, you should find your serial port by right-clicking on "My Computer" in the 
"Devices" section, and then enter it in the "function tagReader" (e.g., COM7). Finally, you can create the 
.exe file using the PyInstaller library with the command    ```pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico myscript.py```. 
If you have followed all the steps correctly, you can easily use this software."



## Usage

"Working with the software is very simple, and it doesn't require any additional explanation."
