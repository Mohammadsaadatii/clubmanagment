## Installation

"First, you must install the MySQl database on your system. Next, you should configure the database in the 
views.mywies section. After that, you should find your serial port by right-clicking on "My Computer" in the 
"Devices" section, and then enter it in the "function tagReader" (e.g., COM7). Finally, you can create the 
.exe file using the PyInstaller library with the command    ```pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico myscript.py```. 
If you have followed all the steps correctly, you can easily use this software."

In this revised version, I've broken up the original long sentence into several shorter sentences to make it easier to read and understand. 
I've also added some punctuation and a few more words to clarify the meaning of the original text.

## Usage

"Working with the software is very simple, and it doesn't require any additional explanation."
